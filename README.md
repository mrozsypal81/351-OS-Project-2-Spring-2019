Contribution:
Alex and Rodrigo collaborated to create the design of the program.
Lambert and Michael worked together on the code and implementation of the program.
Group members collaborated through meetings or working with each other online from home. 
Members would discuss problems and propose solutions to those problems, whether it was a design, code, or implementation issue.
